## Project No 3. NARRATIVE ANALYSIS SOLUTIONS

Tech stack: Java SE. 
Project time frame: 2018 Sep - Dec 2020. 
Team: 2 members. 
Role: developer (including the uploaded part).

Project scope: sales development for an insurance company.

Description:  the project was based on a client request, sales campaigns were analyzed to improve sales results. Client data and sales calls were analysed in details with different methodology, including statistics, linguistic analysis and psychological analysis. This consulting work was partially built on existing tools, and customized software tools were also developed. The software solutions were designed for internal use in order to increase the capacity of in-depth analysis of large amount of texts, and also to catch patterns that would not emerge otherwise. (The uploaded part of a customized solution represents one of the tools: a basic tool which counts frequencies of words in a text, counts specific sets of selected words, counts selected words within a specific range of key words, and able to apply dictionaries to compare absolute and relative frequencies of words in different text samples. This tool is built into a larger system of tools, providing complex analysis options for consulting.)

Results: the pilot sales campaigns built on the analysis results improved sales turnover by 74% in average.
