## Project No.1. CAR WASH

This program supports an SME car wash business to store its turnover, material orders and storage levels. The program offers options to calculate materials used for the different type of services, calculating materials used per service and material costs per service as well, thus helping planning material orders, cost controlling and pricing. In addition the software can generate reports summarizing existing reports over time, calculating the quantities and costs more accurately, including recalculating the material quantites needed for the different services for different size vehicles.
